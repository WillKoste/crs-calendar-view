#CRS Calendar Preview

This React app was created using `create-react-app` and includes these additional dependencies:

```
"react-router-dom": "^5.3.0",
"react-big-calendar": "^0.38.0",
"moment": "^2.29.1",
"@material-ui/core": "^4.12.3",
"@material-ui/icons": "^4.11.2"
```

I used the [zip file that was provided](https://crs-consulting.com/temp/dashboard_theme.zip) for reference, as well as the documentation for anything I had to brush up on. The entire project took about 4.5 hours from first viewing the requirements, up to finishing.

No Environment variables were necessary.
